A standalone mod and injector for Atlyss (furry game)

### Why?
Honestly I was bored and wanted to see what I could do with this game I'll probably keep updating this.
<br>
This was mostly done as a test project and for fun lol.

### Note(s)
Launch the game, wait for the main menu to appear then inject or enter the game fully then inject, both ways work. <br>
Press 'TAB' to Open and Close the Mod Menu. <br>
If any function breaks just turn it off and on again. <br>
You can use this in multiplayer but it only works 85% of the time. <br>
This game mod/trainer is for educational purposes. <br>
