# Catalyss
A standalone mod and injector for Atlyss (furry game)
<br>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2768430/ATLYSS/

### Why?
Honestly I was bored and wanted to see what I could do with this game I'll probably add more later on (Weapon drops, money drops, etc)
<br>
This was mostly done as a test project lol and for fun

### Plans
A better GUI and more features (when I have time lol)
<br>
Multiplayer support (Not sure if this currently works online but you can try it)
<br>
Support to load other mods or load with other mods (Currently Catalyss doesn't work with Bepin or Melonloader because it's standalone)

### Note(s)
Launch the game, wait for the main menu to appear then inject. <br>
Press 'F' to Open and Close the Mod Menu. <br>
If any function breaks just turn it off and on again (Will be fixed next update). <br>
